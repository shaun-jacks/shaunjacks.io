# Semantic Versioning

  

To organize your applications into organized segments, we use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) aka [Semver](https://semver.org/).

  

Here's Semver in a gist:

  

We version applications like so:
`<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>` .
 
 
Every time we decide to create a new release after the previous release, we must "bump" the version up according to the types of changes that will be released.

  
  Following this table, we decide which version to "bump"; the example is if we are starting from version 1.2.0:

| Type of Change | Description  | Example
|--|--|--|
|  Major| The next release will include ***breaking*** changes and is not compatible with previous version | 1.2.0 -> 2.0.0
| Minor| New features, compatible with previous| 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0
| Patch | Normally for bug fixes, compatible with previous| 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1

# Semantic Versioning with Git

In order to apply this concept with Git, we use [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). That way, we can create a tag based off of the last commit in the project.

We can view all of the tags in the git repo with

```
git tag
```

## Examples

### Minor bump

If your project is starting at version 2.1.0, you would do 

```
git tag -a 2.2.0 -m 'Version bump to 2.2.0'
```
This will tag your project to version 2.2.0 based off of the last commit of the branch you are on. It will also include a message with the tag with message contents of whatever is in the quotation marks.

Next, you would push this tag to remote with

```
git push origin <branch name> --follow-tags
```

Doing this will not only push all the commits from local to remote on that branch, it will also push any tags that are local to the remote repo.

## Cheatsheet

```
# Major bump
# From 3.2.0 -> 4.0.0
git tag -a 4.0.0 -m 'Version bump to 4.0.0'
# Minor bump
# From 3.2.0 -> 3.3.0
git tag -a 3.3.0 -m 'Version bump to 3.3.0'
# Patch bump
# From 3.2.0 -> 3.2.1
git tag -a 3.2.1 -m 'Version bump to 3.2.1'
```

And that's it!

The idea is every time you want to create a new release based off of the changes you made before the previous release, you bump the version accordingly and tag it with Git.

There is actually a whole process that incorporates semantic versioning with Git, called [Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) that I highly recommend reading about.
