# Where I am

## 2020

Currently, I am a junior software engineer at Sony Playstation. I work on the Cloud Frontend team, and am constantly exposed to large-scale software technologies and solving problems that encompass complex distributed systems.

I have also just been accepted to a Master's in Computer Science program at Georgia Tech, one of the top ten computer science schools in the nation, and will be starting in January 2021.

# Where I started

I actually graduated in 2018 with a degree in Electrical Engineering, with zero internship experience, and a 3.0 GPA.

I just want to put it out there, if you are graduating from college with zero internship experience, and with a GPA that is not the best, there is hope.

My journey however started in 2014.

## 2014

I wish I could tell you a story of how I was 8 years old and tinkered with my dad's computer, with the joys of hearing a computer tell me "Hello World!".

### My first experience programming was actually quite jarring

It was my second quarter at U.C. Davis, taking my first ever programming course. And it was in C.

I remember being overly confident that I could easily pick up learning how to code. Fast forward 10 weeks later, I was leaving my final, feeling utterly defeated.

### I finished the course with a D+.

This was the worst grade I ever had in my history of school.

Thinking back, I failed because I thought I could get by through pure procrastination and knowledge cramming. This failure taught me two simple but important lessons from the beginning I would never forget:

Learning how to code requires **_consistency_** and **_learning by doing_**.

### Because of this, I did not pursue software for 4 years

This scarring experience in school prevented me from further exploring the wonders of computer science. Instead, I stuck with my original major - electrical engineering, but never felt very passionate about it.

## 2018

This was when the light bulb lit up for me. This my friend was no normal light bulb, it was a bulb that emitted a light source that could penetrate through the strongest of material known in the universe.

It was in my Embedded Systems class at UC Davis:

I taught a microcontroller to speak another language! How? In the shortest summary:

- Used an infrared circuit to detect a remote signal that I would send through a remote
- Decode this signal in C and translate it to a text message
- sent the text message to AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Used AWS Lambda function along with Google Translate API to translate text to another language
- Converted translated text to speech with AWS polly
- AWS SNS sends AWS Polly audio output of speech back to me through email or text message

**Building a real world project, and seeing it work, fueled my love for building things with software, and gave me the confidence to keep going even when it's hard**.

# Enter the real world

## 2018

Graduating from school, I had zero internship experience. All I had was a degree, and a passion to learn more and grow. I found my first job in research and data science at the U.C. Davis MIND Institute working as a Junior Specialist.

A junior specialist is a very general position but one that is focused on research.

There I gained experience in **R**, and learned to automate the lives of researchers around me. In addition, I learned about **data** and how to **store**, **clean**, and **analyze** it.

My hunger to learn did not stop with my full-time job, I went back to school and took a course in Algorithms through UC Davis Extension. I attended my first hackathon at HackDavis.

Every day, I would work in data science and research until around 5pm, and every night I would build up my software engineering skills through practice. I ingested every learning source I could get my mind on.

# How I learned Software Engineering

## 2019

## I gained technical experience in my research role

Coming from a research position, I did what I could to gain experience in new technologies. I jumped on the opportunities to work with MySQL, and to use GIT in our code.

## Learning through hands-on projects

I had a hard time knowing where to start. One of my first learning resources was through YouTube. I started by coding along with Brad Traversy's youtube videos. It was so fun seeing the code I wrote spring to life on a computer!

I then found an **amazing** set of courses on codewithmosh.com. I would go through his Mastering React and Node.js courses.

I also found a great set of Udemy courses by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on web development projects. I followed his courses to further learn about full stack javascript.

Last but not least, I went through one of my favorite Udemy courses on understanding how Javascript works as a language. This course was beautifully made, and was called Javascript: Understanding the weird parts.

## My projects

I used all the resources I found online, to start building personal projects. One of the biggest projects I worked on was a music social media application. If you're curious this is it.

What about computer vision and deep learning? I checked out some cool videos on fast.ai, and used fastai to build a classifier to identify cells with Malaria.

One weekend I felt very inspired, and created a frontend prototype of a trading admin application using React you can see here.

### Put your projects on github

This is very important so that you can gain experience with Git as well as have the ability to share code with others.

## What my projects taught me

1. First and foremost, **I learned how to teach myself** and **find solutions with the resources I was given**.
2. I learned about frontend and backend communication via HTTP
3. I learned about authentication and authorization
4. I gained experience in database organization via SQL or NoSQL
5. I learned about modern frontend technologies and State Management

# Preparing for Interviews

## S.T.A.R. stories

I created STAR stories for every situation I could think of at work. STAR stands for:

S: situation
T: task
A: action
R: result

For example,

**Situation:** Our data pipeline tool took 20 minutes to output data.

**Task:** To fix this we needed to find a way to more efficiently get data to users.

**Action:** I implemented caching strategies in our pipeline.

**Result:** Caching decreased query times from 20min to around 10 seconds, dramatically improving efficiency.

I made as many of these stories as I could, the more you have the better.

## The Resume

I started my resume with a brief summary about myself and what I bring.

### Experience Section using S.T.A.R. stories

I included the most relevant S.T.A.R. stories for the job I applied for.

### My Projects section

Since I was knew to the field of Software Engineering, I described the projects I have done as related to the role I applied for. I made sure to order my projects either by date or relevancy to the job. For example, if I applied to a frontend position, I would include projects highlighting my React.js experience. If I applied for a more backend position, I would highlight about my database and Node.js experience through my projects.

### Ask for feedback and Iterate!

I would constantly send my resume to friends and family to help proofread. I would create many versions of my resume. I would apply to roles and modify my resume to fit the role. Rinse, repeat.

## Algorithm Prep.

The next step is to learn how to solve algorithms problems. This one truly takes consistent practice. What resources helped me the most in this one? There are a plethora of ways to go about this, but what helped me most is this:

1. Practice problems in Cracking The Coding Interview, go through the first set of problems in a variety of sections
2. Practice problems in Elements of Programming Interviews in your language of choice (the problems in here are also amazing and solutions described well), also start with the first problems and focus on variety of problems
3. Practice sets of problems on Leetcode
4. Look up solutions to coding problems on YouTube to help see how to solve them
5. Practice on a whiteboard in your room, speaking through the solutions out loud!

Keep doing this consistently, and you would be ready for Algorithms problems. I would start with problems in one of the above books.

## Behavioral Interview Prep

Back to the key, **think about your S.T.A.R. stories!**. Create as many as you can. I created at least 3 pages of S.T.A.R. stories.

Next, I wrote down at least 20 behavioral interview questions that were general. I then connected my S.T.A.R. stories to each question. I would practice speaking out loud answers to each one. I also practiced with friends and family, having them ask me questions, and me answering them.

# Applying for roles

While I prepared for the interview, I asynchronously sent out applications to roles I was both most interested in, and that were out of my comfort zone.

When I applied to a specific role, I looked at my S.T.A.R. stories, and modified my resume to include experience I had most relevant to the position I applied for. If I had an interview setup, I would take a break from applying for roles and focus more on interview preparation.

## My application stats

I applied for jobs over the course of three months. In those three months, I applied to 70+ positions.

Out of 70+ applications, I ended up with:

- 4-5 contacts from recruiters of different companies
- 3 separate phone screen interviews for 3 different companies
- 2 onsite interviews for two different companies
- 2 job offers

Note, these are the stats given my complete lack of internship experience, or real world experience in the role, other than the data experience I had in research.

**I made up for my lack of experience through the hands-on projects I made on the side.** This I believe is the most important point that helped me transition into software.

# In Summary...

- Getting into Software Engineering or Data Science with zero experience to begin with is possible!
  - We all start somewhere, my first experience it was incredibly hard (maybe don't start with C please...)
- I learned by **consistently doing** through building **hands-on projects** I could showcase
  - YouTube, Udemy, MOOCs, Google, blogs are all enough to get started
  - Build a project that is unique to something you are passionate about
- Create as many **S.T.A.R.** stories as possible, include in **resume**, and practice speaking them out loud to answer **behavioral questions**
- Practice Algorithm Problems on a whiteboard while talking through solutions
  - Cracking the Coding Interview, Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI), and Leetcode to help
- Never stop learning and practicing!
